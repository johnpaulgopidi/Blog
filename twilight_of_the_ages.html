      <p></p>


<p>The world is going to end!. This is a statement that needs no introduction, we hear a lot of frightning causes, the likes of global warming, meteor hail and many others, making believe it is certain that this will end. But, the statement need to be introduced in a whole new different way, or perhaps knowing the right way to look at it. If you say to me the world is going to end soon, I will be one of the happiest persons knowing this, not beacuse I enjoy death, but because my blessed hope will finally have come true. This article is an effort and my prayer that you will see it through my eyes.</p>

 To know more of this let's turn the pages of history back to when the nation of Israel went exile into Babylon in the 6th century BC. During this period there was a man with an excellant spirit named Daniel, he was only second in command in the Babylonian kingdom; to achieve this being a foreign national is climbing a great stride. If you are wondering how a foreign national, an exile, in the '6th century BC' way of handling foreign exiles did see himself as a vice-president (a prime minister), look no further than God, The Scriptrues reveal..   
<p></p>

      <div class="bible-verse">
        
You(God) prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows.
 <br />
      <strong>– Psalm 23:5 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <h2>In the Beginning...</h2>
      <p>The Scriptures begin with the Phrase, "In the beginning...", in other words it is the grand announcement of the birth of Time. In the book of Genesis, when we read, "In the beginning(time) God created the heavens(space) and the earth(matter)", we observe only God is the one who is clearly outside of time, space and matter i.e. outside of this universe. The scripture also says that He is in the unapproachable light (1 Timothy 6:16)</p>

      <p>If you are like me, when I found myself lost in the cosmos, searching for the purpose of life, and been half-hearted in addressing this important question, numbing myself with all the entertainment and pleasure that this world has to offer, let me tell you, that I was spiritually dead; I had to address this sooner or later, the weight of it eventually failed me in everything that I did. My answer to every question is found in Lord Jesus Christ, I acceptd Him as my Lord and Saviour and found my purpose in Him, I encourage you to consider Him too, He is gentle and humble at heart, He will not refuse you anytime, and He is waiting for you right now. Only believe, and you will see yourself. </p>

      <p> The scripture tells about the whole purpose of the mankind...
      <div class="bible-verse">
      
      Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, For this is man's all.
 <br />
        <strong>– Ecclesiastes 12:13 NKJV</strong><br /><br />

      
        He has told you, mortal one, what is good; And what does the Lord require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God?<br />
              <strong>– Micah 6:8 NASB</strong>
      </div>

      <p>I have known Him as my creator and He has redeemed me from the pride, sin (falling short of obedience to His commandments), and the blindness that a 'free-will' mindset brings, don't mistaken me that I lost my senses, I chose Him as my Lord, with my own free will, when I was knocked into my senses. Sin keeps a man dead, away from God (away from true freedom), just like the fish out of the water.</p>

      <h2>The Ticking Clock: A 70 Weeks Timeline</h2>
      <p>God’s promise to Daniel covers 70 weeks, a complete plan to bring His people back to Him and make everything right. This timeline includes the past, present, and future, all centered on Jesus.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the wrongdoing, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for guilt, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy Place.<br />
        <strong>– Daniel 9:24 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>This promise is about hope: ending sin, forgiving guilt, and bringing God’s eternal righteousness. It’s a reminder that God has a purpose for every moment, and He invites us to trust Him.</p>

      <h2>What Has Already Happened</h2>
      <h3>The Messiah’s Coming and Sacrifice</h3>
      <p>The first part of God’s plan has already come true. Jesus, the Messiah, came to save us, just as Daniel’s prophecy foretold.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Then after the sixty-two weeks, the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined.<br />
        <strong>– Daniel 9:26 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>Jesus came, lived among us, and gave His life on the cross to forgive our sins. After His death, Jerusalem and its temple were destroyed, just as God said. But through Jesus’ sacrifice, we find hope and new life.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br />
        <strong>– John 3:16 NKJV</strong>
      </div>

      <h2>What Is Still to Come</h2>
      <p>The final week of Daniel’s prophecy is still to come. I believe it points to future events in which God will bring His plan to completion. What I’m sharing here is simply my current understanding. I’ve grouped the Scriptures into sections, not to form a new interpretation, but only to help us see this as a collection of what the Bible itself says. One thing is certain: when the Lord returns, He will bring an end to sin and that will mark the end of this world. So let’s turn to the Scriptures and see what they reveal.</p>
      <h3>A New Temple</h3>
      <p>The Bible hints at a future temple, a place where God’s people will worship Him again.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Then there was given to me a measuring rod like a staff; and someone said, “Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it.”<br />
        <strong>– Revelation 11:1 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>This vision shows a time when God’s temple will be central again, a sign of His presence among His people.</p>

      <h3>The First Half of the Week: A Time of Peace</h3>
      <p>The final week may begin with a promise of peace, but it won’t last. A leader will make a covenant, perhaps offering hope to many.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the middle of the week he shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate.<br />
        <strong>– Daniel 9:27 NKJV</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.<br />
        <strong>– 1 Thessalonians 5:3 NASB</strong>
      </div>

      <h3>The Middle of the Week: A Turning Point</h3>
      <p>In the middle of this week, the peace will break. Sacrifices will stop, and a time of trouble will begin.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        And he will confirm a covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come the one who makes desolate, until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, gushes forth on the one who makes desolate.<br />
        <strong>– Daniel 9:27 NASB</strong>
      </div>

      <h3>The Second Half of the Week: A Time of Trial</h3>
      <p>The second half of the week will bring challenges, as the world turns against God’s people.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Leave out the courtyard which is outside the temple and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations; and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.<br />
        <strong>– Revelation 11:2 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>God will also send two witnesses to speak His truth during this time, calling people to turn to Him.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days (3½ years), clothed in sackcloth.<br />
        <strong>– Revelation 11:3 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>The two witnesses will face great opposition, but God will show His power through them.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them. And their dead bodies will lie on the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. Those from the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. And those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who live on the earth. And after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them.<br />
        <strong>– Revelation 11:7-11 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>Even in dark times, God’s power will shine, showing that He is always in control.</p>

      <h2>The End of the Week: Jesus Returns</h2>
      <p>At the end of the week, Jesus will return in glory, bringing His kingdom forever.</p>
      <h3>The Lord’s Reign Begins</h3>
      <h4>The Seventh Trumpet</h4>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.”<br />
        <strong>– Revelation 11:15 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Behold, I am telling you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.<br />
        <strong>– 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.<br />
        <strong>– 1 Thessalonians 4:16 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet blast, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.<br />
        <strong>– Matthew 24:31 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>When Jesus returns, He will gather His people and reign forever, fulfilling every promise.</p>

      <h2>Stay Watchful</h2>
      <p>God calls us to stay alert, ready for His return, because He loves us and wants us to be with Him.</p>
      <h3>Israel Missed the Messiah’s First Coming</h3>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        And they will level you to the ground, and throw down your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.<br />
        <strong>– Luke 19:44 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>Israel didn’t see Jesus as the Messiah when He came, and they faced great loss. Let’s learn from this and keep our hearts open.</p>

      <h3>God Calls Us to Be Ready</h3>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he comes; truly I say to you, that he will prepare himself to serve, and have them recline at the table, and he will come up and serve them.<br />
        <strong>– Luke 12:37 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming.<br />
        <strong>– Matthew 24:42 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>Jesus asks us to stay awake and ready, trusting Him each day, because He will come back at an unexpected time.</p>

      <h2>The World and Jesus’ Glorious Return</h2>
      <p>The world may seem to offer peace, like recent efforts to bring nations together, but true peace comes only from Jesus. When He returns, everyone will see His glory.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord is coming just like a thief in the night. While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, so that the day would overtake you like a thief; for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness; so then, let’s not sleep as others do, but let’s be alert and sober.<br />
        <strong>– 1 Thessalonians 5:2-6 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet blast, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.<br />
        <strong>– Matthew 24:29-31 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves, people fainting from fear and the expectation of the things that are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.<br />
        <strong>– Luke 21:25-28 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen.<br />
        <strong>– Revelation 1:7 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were watching, and a cloud took Him up, out of their sight. And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, then behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them, and they said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.”<br />
        <strong>– Acts 1:9-11 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore, comfort one another with these words.<br />
        <strong>– 1 Thessalonians 4:17-18 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>When Jesus returns, He will bring us to Himself, and we will be with Him forever. This hope keeps us strong, no matter what we face in the world.</p>

      <h2>A Pattern of Two’s: God’s Timing</h2>
      <p>God’s Word shows a pattern that points to His perfect timing, often in twos, reminding us to trust His plan.</p>
      <h3>Two Thousand Years Since Jesus’ Resurrection</h3>
      <p>It’s been about 2,000 years since Jesus rose from the dead, a sign that His return may be near.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.<br />
        <strong>– 2 Peter 3:8 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, that we may live before Him.<br />
        <strong>– Hosea 6:2 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>These verses suggest that after a time like “two days” in God’s eyes, He will bring new life to His people.</p>

      <h3>Lazarus Raised After Two Days</h3>
      <p>Jesus waited two days before raising Lazarus, showing His power over death and His perfect timing.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was. Then after this He said to the disciples, “Let’s go to Judea again.” The disciples said to Him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and yet You are going there again?” Jesus replied, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks during the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if anyone walks during the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.” This He said, and after this He said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may awaken him from sleep.”<br />
        <strong>– John 11:6-11 NASB</strong>
      </div>

      <h3>Jesus’ Resurrection on the Third Day</h3>
      <p>Jesus Himself rose on the third day, fulfilling God’s promise of victory over death.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Saying that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise from the dead.<br />
        <strong>– Luke 24:7 NASB</strong>
      </div>

      <h3>Returning After Two Days’ Wages</h3>
      <p>In a parable, Jesus spoke of a man who gave two days’ wages and promised to return.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        On the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, ‘Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I return, I will repay you.’<br />
        <strong>– Luke 10:35 NASB</strong>
      </div>

      <h3>Looking Forward to His Return</h3>
      <p>The pattern of twos reminds us that Jesus’ return will be glorious, and we should live ready for Him.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves, people fainting from fear and the expectation of the things that are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.<br />
        <strong>– Luke 21:25-28 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen.<br />
        <strong>– Revelation 1:7 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were watching, and a cloud took Him up, out of their sight. And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, then behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them, and they said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.”<br />
        <strong>– Acts 1:9-11 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>Let’s hold fast to this hope, living each day for Jesus, knowing He is coming soon to make all things new.</p>
