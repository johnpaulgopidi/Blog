      <h1>Overcoming Complacency</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-meta">July 9, 2025</div>

    <article>
      <p>Complacency can quietly creep into our lives, pulling us away from God’s path. It’s like falling asleep when we’re meant to stay awake, missing the life God has for us. Let’s look at five ways we can become complacent and how God’s Word calls us to stay faithful.</p>

      <h2>1. Tolerating Sin</h2>
      <p>When we let sin slide, whether in our lives or around us, we drift from God. Ignoring wrong choices or false teachings can make us numb to His truth.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        	For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, this you tolerate very well!
<br />
        <strong>– 2 Corinthians 11:4 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        For I have told him that I am going to judge his house forever for the wrongdoing that he knew, because his sons were bringing a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them.<br />
        <strong>– 1 Samuel 3:13 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>Eli knew his sons were sinning but didn’t correct them, and the Corinthians accepted false teachings. Let’s ask God for courage to stand for His truth.</p>

      <h2>2. Seeking Instant Gratification</h2>
      <p>Chasing quick rewards can lead us to trade God’s best for temporary comfort. Esau gave up his birthright for a bowl of stew, and Israel ignored God’s command to avoid false altars, missing His full blessing.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        	When Jacob had cooked a stew one day, Esau came in from the field and he was exhausted; and Esau said to Jacob, “Please let me have a mouthful of that red stuff there, for I am exhausted.” Therefore he was called Edom by name. But Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.” Esau said, “Look, I am about to die; so of what use then is the birthright to me?” And Jacob said, “First swear to me”; so he swore an oath to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.
<br />
        <strong>– Genesis 25:32-33 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        	Now the angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I have sworn to your fathers; and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you, and as for you, you shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed Me; what is this thing that you have done? Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from you; but they will become like thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’”
          <br />
        <strong>– Judges 2:1-2 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>God has greater plans for us. Let’s trust Him and wait for His promises.</p>

      <h2>3. Neglecting Our Duties</h2>
      <p>When we avoid what God calls us to do, we open the door to sin. David stayed home instead of leading his army, leading to his sin with Bathsheba. Jonah fled from God’s command to go to Nineveh.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king’s men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem. One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful, and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, “She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her monthly uncleanness.) Then she went back home. The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.”<br />
        <strong>– 2 Samuel 11:1-5 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        	The word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, “Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry out against it, because their wickedness has come up before Me.” But Jonah got up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. So he went down to Joppa, found a ship that was going to Tarshish, paid the fare, and boarded it to go with them to Tarshish away from the presence of the Lord.<br />
        <strong>– Jonah 1:1-3 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        So for one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, for him it is sin.<br />
        <strong>– James 4:17 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>God calls us to act faithfully. Let’s do what He asks, even when it’s hard.</p>

      <h2>4. Not Staying Alert</h2>
      <p>Complacency makes us spiritually sleepy, missing God’s warnings. Lord Jesus asked His disciples to stay awake and pray, but they slept. The Bible urges us to stay vigilant, as the rich fool learned too late.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and told His disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” And He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, and began to be grieved and distressed. Then He said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch with Me.” And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will.” And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter, “So, you men could not keep watch with Me for one hour? Keep watching and praying, so that you do not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”<br />
        <strong>– Matthew 26:36-41 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        So then, let’s not sleep as others do, but let’s be alert and sober.<br />
        <strong>– 1 Thessalonians 5:6 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        And I will say to myself, “You have many goods stored up for many years to come; relax, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself!”’ But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your soul is demanded of you; and as for all that you have prepared, who will own it now?<br />
        <strong>– Luke 12:19-20 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>Let’s stay awake, praying and watching for God’s guidance every day.</p>

      <h2>5. Lacking Zeal for God</h2>
      <p>When our love for God grows cold, we lose our passion for serving Him. The church in Ephesus forgot their first love, and Hezekiah cared more for his own peace than God’s will.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.<br />
        <strong>– Romans 12:11 NIV</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        	But I have this against you, that you have left your first love. Therefore, remember from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and I will remove your lampstand from its place—unless you repent.<br />
        <strong>– Revelation 2:4-5 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord: ‘Behold, the days are coming when everything that is in your house, and what your fathers have stored up to this day, will be carried to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the Lord. ‘And some of your sons who will come from you, whom you will father, will be taken away; and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’” Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Is it not good, if there will be peace and security in my days?”<br />
        <strong>– 2 Kings 20:16-19 NASB</strong>
      </div>
      <p>Let’s rekindle our love for God, serving Him with all our heart.</p>

      <h2>A Call to Action</h2>
      <p>Complacency can pull us away from God, but His grace calls us back. Let’s turn to Jesus, ask for forgiveness, and follow Him with all our heart. He is ready to guide us into a life of purpose and joy.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        And we desire that each one of you demonstrate the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end, so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and endurance inherit the promises.<br />
        <strong>– Hebrews 6:11-12 NASB</strong>
      </div>
