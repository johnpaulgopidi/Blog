    <article>
      <p>

      I was born into a Christian family, which meant that, like many Christians I grew up learning Biblical stories and believing in the existence of God. Somewhere in me there was Godly fear that He does not spare evil. My mother and grandmother raised me; my mother is a single parent and a working mom. However, sin attracted me very early in the childhood. I chose wrong friendships, becoming very notorious and violent. My playtime often turned into fights with my classmates. In the 6th grade, my poor grades earned me a fierce rebuke from my family and that led me to change friendship. I met a studios kid and we became best friends. I thought everything is finally going well, until the moment when God chose to draw me towards him for the first time: In the 8th grade, my best friend left me to another school and I broke down mentally, fear of future gripped me and my relationship with another human was never the same since. I learned it in a hard way that no human can be with me at all times.</p>

      <p>Now relationships have become so sacred to me, that I didn't really have any friends who are close to me later on. This was the second incident that pushed me closer to God  that in my 10th grade summer vacation I happened to read Matthew 12:31-32, which became one of my intense spiritual battles. Blasphemous thoughts plagued my mind and I silently suffered for a long time without telling anyone. I broke down, losing all hope, and believed there was no salvation for me. At that moment, when I was seeking for God's mercy with bitter cry I opened my Bible to Isaiah 60:1, which says, <font color="red">“Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you.”</font> That verse assured me that God still loved me and had not abandoned me to hell.
</p><p>
      At this point I accepted Lord Jesus as my Saviour and believed that He still loved me. However, I didn’t fully understand why someone would have to die for me. Overtime God made me understand the true meaning of His death on the cross. The Bible says that, 'Romans 3:23 (NLT)<font color="red">For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God's glorious standard'</font>. Just a plant cannot survive without soil, or a fish without water, humans cannot truly live without a relationship with God. Death is inevitable without Him. To revive us from that spiritual death, to give us eternal life, because God is a just God, the right justification is putting someone's life down instead, now that He loved us so much that He was ready to give His own life to give us life, a perfect and sinless sacrifice, taking upon Himself the punishment we deserved. Now that He has power over death, He has risen and gave mankind eternal life, for all who believe in Jesus. There is no true peace and life without Him. We are all lost and searching for love, joy and fulfilment, but we try to find it in wrong places like I did such as in friendships, in social media, in money and in work, but the true love is found in Lord Jesus Christ. The greatest act of love is described in John 15:13: <font color="red">“There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”</font> That is the answer—He died for me because He loved me.
</p><p>
      Now when I began to believe this by faith, God began a lot of changes in my character, As I read the Bible, He shaped me with His character. He began to remove every evil that is kept me away from Him such as anger, depression, fear, anxieties, watching pornography, lies, swearing, tendency to be easily offended, and selfishness. Not that I won't get tempted by these things now, but God equips me with the strength to overcome them. I am no longer a slave to sin. He forgives me and empowers me to live victoriously. Now, I don’t want this to remain a secret, I want to declare my victory over sin in Lord Jesus Christ before all of you. I want to testify that Lord Jesus is my Light, the One who enlightened me to renounce the darkness of this world. I want to declare my death to this world and my new life dedicated to living for Him.
</p><p>
      <b>I would say to everyone who is searching for love, that no human being can be with you, be it your own family at all times, look to Jesus, my one true love.</b>
